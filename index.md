I am a product management, engineering and analytics professional, experienced with geomechanics, data analysis, statistics as well as software development.  

More than 10 years of experience in technical analysis, energy consultancy and  software development bringing expert usage of analytical and BI tools. Scripted with Python and used relational databases throughout my industry experience, in upstream oil and gas as well as medical device and healthcare industries.


I've earned a Master's of Science in Petroleum Engineering from [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and a Bachelor's of Science in Physics from [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US)

This website is meant to showcase a small portion of my BI/ data science projects that I have worked on my own time and can be shared--outside of paid client/consulting.
