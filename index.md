I am an engineering and analytics professional experienced with data analysis, technical consulting, project management, statistics and software development within an agile framework. 

I have 8 years of experience as a technical analyst and energy consultant. I've used SQL and Python and exposed to R, C++/C# and Visual Basic. I bring expert usage of MS Excel, Visio, PowerPoint, Access, TFS, Jira and I have mutiple project experience of Tableau analysis, visualization, customer segmentation and forecasting studies. 


I've earned a Master's of Science in Petroleum Engineering from [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and a Bachelor's of Science in Physics from [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US)

This website is meant to showcase a small portion of my projects that I have worked on my own time and can be shared--outside of paid client/consulting work.
