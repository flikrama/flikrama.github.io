I am an engineering and analytics professional experienced with data analysis, geomechanics, statistics as well as software development within an agile framework. 

I have more than 9 years of experience in technical analysis, energy consultancy and  software development bringing expert usage of most analytical and BI tools. I've used Python, SQL and git during my whole industry experience.


I've earned a Master's of Science in Petroleum Engineering from [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and a Bachelor's of Science in Physics from [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US)

This website is meant to showcase a small portion of my projects that I have worked on my own time and can be shared--outside of paid client/consulting.
