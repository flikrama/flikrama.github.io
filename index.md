I am an engineering and analytics professional experienced with data analysis, geomechanics, statistics as well as software development within an agile framework. 

I have 8 years of experience as a technical analyst and energy consultant bringing expert usage of MS Excel, Visio, Access, TFS, Jira with multiple project experience of Tableau analysis, visualization, customer segmentation and forecasting studies. I've used Python and SQL during my whole industry experience.


I've earned a Master's of Science in Petroleum Engineering from [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and a Bachelor's of Science in Physics from [Bogazici University](http://www.boun.edu.tr/en_US)

This website is meant to showcase a small portion of my projects that I have worked on my own time and can be shared--outside of paid client/consulting.
