With high globalization and its rapidity, air transportation has become one of the favourite modes of transportation for many people. With this popularity comes the pain: flight delays.

At the very least flight delays waste the time of multiple people and at the worst they cause environmental harm by rise in fuel consumption. Around 21% of the flights were delayed in United statesin the year 2019 as per Air travel consumer report. These costs billions of dollars loss to the airport companies and travellers. Airport management teams are therefore thinking that alerting people about flight delay prior to the journey and reducing flight delays are high priority problems to be solved in onwards scenarios. 

This motivates to formulate this business problem and find probable solution for it by learning from historical data. The focus is predicting the delays with the use of informative attributes. To carry out the predictive analysis, the model encompassed various statistical techniques and machine learning techniques.

Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and AdaBoost Classifier methods were applied with libraries from SciKit Learn package. A simple neural network was also constructed using the Keras Library.

Exploratory data analysis identifies cyclicity in flight delays with respect to week days (Friday with the highest rate of delays and Monday with the least) and also identifies the biggest offending airlines and airports. It also identifies which departure time is most likely to result in delays. With the exception of Decision Tree classifier which showed poorer results the rest of the predictive methods were similar in results. A precision of 0.74-0.8 is obtained in predicting whether a flight will be delayed.

The defaults parameters were applied in all the models. It's very likely that results may improve somewhat by optimizing the parameters.

The models can be already used in a real world scenario to improve the flying experience and save a lot of waste.
