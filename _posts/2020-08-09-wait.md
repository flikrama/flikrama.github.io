Air transportation has become one of the favourite modes of transportation for many people. With this popularity comes the pain: flight delays.

At the very least flight delays waste the time of multiple people and at the worst they cause environmental harm by rise in fuel consumption. Around 21% of the flights were delayed in United statesin the year 2019 as per Air travel consumer report. These costs billions of dollars loss to the airport companies and travellers. Airport management teams are therefore thinking that alerting people about flight delay prior to the journey and reducing flight delays are high priority problems to be solved in onwards scenarios. 

Can we predict whether a flight will arrive late? We tried...

Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and AdaBoost Classifier methods were applied with libraries from SciKit Learn package. A simple neural network was also constructed using the Keras Library. 

Exploratory data analysis identifies cyclicity in flight delays with respect to week days (Friday with the highest rate of delays and Monday with the least) and also identifies the biggest offending airlines and airports. It also identifies which departure time is most likely to result in delays. 

However, none of the models beats the baseline of guessing the arrival delay of a flight on its departure delay alone. It is likely that more data would remedy this but in this case an analyst would be better applying a much simpler model just based on departure delay alone.
