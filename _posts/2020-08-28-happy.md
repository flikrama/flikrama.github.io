Would you rather be rich or happy? I'd rather be both...and healthy too!

People have started to see happiness as a metric to measure success besides economic indicators.
Being happy is a simple but profound feeling. It is also hard to define. Nevertheless, its measure may point to the gaps in the government development policies and some may view the measure as peopleâ€™s perception of how their government performs.  The insights from its analysis also helps in pointing out the importance of development in several aspects instead of just narrowly in economic indicators.

This work is focused on datasets (from 2015 to 2019) from the World Happiness Report Landmark Survey. Its objective is predicting the happiness score of a country based on independent features and identifying the key variables and potentially their interactions.

Turns out we can predict mean happiness score of people in a location with an error of about 0.55 (better than a strict baseline) as per the above scoring criteria. Ridge and Lasso gave very similar results with Elastic Net Regression model giving only a slight improvement.

Happiness is affected the most by Economic Wellbeing, followed by Health, Social Support and Freedom. 

Even this simple dataset with not too many features it is not trivial to deal with collinearity or with non-linear effects. 2nd order polynomial fits were attempted with no huge improvements. It may be that another (non-linear) method may work better.
